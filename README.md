Tutorial on Git and GitHub

GitHub is a platform to host your code, making collaboration very easy.  It makes working on projects with multiple people a whole lot simpler.  It is the most popular Source Code Management software, practically used everywhere in technology.

Another piece of software that is very useful to pair with GitHub is Webstorm.  Webstorm is an IDE that allows you to manage your GitHub projects directly in the IDE.  

Before starting to use GitHub you should first understand what Git is.  Git was an open source project that was started by the creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds. It is a version control system that can manage and store revisions of projects or documents.  This is mostly used for programming files, but it also has applications in such files as Word documents.

To get started with GitHub you must first create an account, very self explenatory.

The main basic function of GitHub is repositories.  A repository if where the files for a single project get stored, and they are easily accessed through a specific URL.  To start a repository in the upper left hand corner of your home page you must click the green new button.  From there you can name your repository and describe it along with choosing to make it public or private.  You may also want to select "Initialize this repository with a README" which will immediately clone the repository to your computer.

As for cloning, this function as stated before is downloading a copy of the source code, or text.  The copy on your computer will sync with the original file on GitHub, practically acting as a backup for your project.  You can either clone using Git Bash or clone directly to your desktop, and these options should be located under your repository name.

When creating your repository you may make mistakes and want to make changes, that is when you make commits on your project.  A commit is a revision or an edit on your project.  This can be done by clicking the edit button on the top right of your repository and proceeding to edit your document and hit commit changes on the bottom left when finished.  This will document the time of changes and what changes.  This is very useful for employeers to measure efficiency of their employees. 

You can also push your commits to a remote repository.  A common use is to push your local changes to your online repository.

If you would like to make revision to someone elses project you could create a pull request.  When this happens you are asking for permission from the author of the original repository to have your revisions uploaded to that original repository.  This can be very useful for collaboration on projects, and is infact neccessary.

The connections between all the pushing and pulling is documented as branches.  These branches can all be seen in the branches tab on the main page of your repository.  It will show the branches that you have pushed to, branches that people have committed to, and even branches that noone has committed to recently.  The main function of the branch is to increase collaboration and properly document changes made between repositories.

When looking at all the branches you can put all the seperate branches into on single branch.  This can be useful when there are so many branches created it is hard to keep track of. The basic understanding is taking all these different committs and logging them all together

When you decide to merge your branches, there may be a merge conflict.  A merge conflict happens when the merging branches have commits that compete against eachother.  They can not keep both commits, you must resolve all the merge conlficts before completing the merge.  To do this you can use a conflict editor on GitHub, or for some more in depth conflicts that can not be solved this way you must resolve it in a local clone of the repository.  You can also use the command line to resolve a merge conflict.

If you want to download commits, file and refs remotely into your local repository you must use fetch.  This is used when someone wants to see what someone is working on, such as an administrator or your higher ups where you work.  This would not be as commonly used for a normal user of GitHub, unless you are responsible for the work of others, possibly a project manager.

When you will most likely be working on teams for projects on GitHub you will most likely be using a remote.  A remote is a common repository where the members of the team can share and exchange their commits.  The team members can easily view, fetch or even update your commits to the project. Remote URLs are simply places where your project is stored.

This is a simply start to using GIT and GitHub.  But this simple start and information is still very important in making a splash into developing and gives you a head start in the workplace.  Because you will most definitely be using GitHub if you work in computing.
